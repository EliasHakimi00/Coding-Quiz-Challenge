Week-6-Challenge-
Good lord, this was due on the 24th January but it took me absolutely agees to do. Learned a lot about adding event listeners, storing values in the local storage, and the timer function specifically. I could not figure out how to set it up as the starter code wanted (questions in a separate js file, high scores page on a separate html file) so these are things that I will be looking to learn more about. Overall, this was a really tough challenge, but I think I've managed to meet all the criteria ;)

The link for the deployed site is:

Here are some screenshots of the deployed site: Quiz with three questions. Timer for 30 seconds. Timer has 1 second deducted for each wrong answer. Sounds effects added for right/wrong answers.
